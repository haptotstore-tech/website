      <h2>Brand story</h2>
      <p>HAPTOT was started by parents from Kerala who shop the way parents do — with the heart first. We see every child like our own, so quality is not a checkbox; it’s a promise. That’s why we hand‑check items, avoid gimmicks, and curate products that are safe, durable, and genuinely helpful for learning and daily life.</p>
      <p>With a Just‑in‑Time approach, we keep inventory light and attention heavy — which means fresher stock, fairer prices, and more time to listen to what families actually need. From a small room in Tirur to homes across India, we’re building a store parents can trust with their eyes closed.</p>
